Repository for learning the basics of git

Do the following steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone *your* repository (that you created by the fork) to your local machine.
3. Create a branch with your name or nickname.
4. Add a new file with your name or nickname with any content you wish.
5. Add the new file to the staged ones.
6. Commit the changes
7. Push the branch to your remote repo (it's the same you cloned in step 2).
8. Create a Pull Request to the original repository's master branch.
